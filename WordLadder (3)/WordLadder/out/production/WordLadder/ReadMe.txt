Initialize method is not required- all required variables are initialized and used within their respective Methods. Sort method is implemented in DFS to improve efficiency considerably. HashMaps are also used for both BFS and DFS to most efficiently mark visited Vertices. All class variables are private, but can be reached through given methods. Any additional questions can be sent to dm.cauwels@utexas.edu or by text through (817)-948-4382.}
